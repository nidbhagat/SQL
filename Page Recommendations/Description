Introduction
A page recommendation system for a social media website. Should recommend a page to user_id if the page is liked by at least one friend of user_id and is not liked by user_id.

Usage Case
For various platforms, especially those with a large amount of content and needed a target audience based on their interests, behaviours, and preferences in different categories.
Such as:
1. Social Media Feeds like Instagram, Twitter
2. E-commerce Recommendations like H&M, Amazon
3. Video Streaming Services like Netflix, Amazon Prime


APPROACH:
1. Using CTE created a list of user-friend pairs with UNION to avoid duplication and to get a bidirectional friendship.
2. Then, join the temporary set table with the likes table (return pages liked by the friends).
3. Again using left join to filter out the pages liked by the friends which are already liked by the user.


In real scenarios, Machine learning algorithms, collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering are common techniques used in building recommendation 
systems to deliver more accurate and personalized suggestions.
